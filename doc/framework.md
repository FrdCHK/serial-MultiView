* Framework for a Python pipeline.

This framework actually can be use for any purpose, although it's originally designed for a VLBI pipeline.
The framework itself does not provide any functionality, but it provides a way to organize the pipeline.
Any functionality can be added to the framework by creating new plugins and adding it to the framework.
A congiguration file is used for defining parameters and plugins used for your purpose.
